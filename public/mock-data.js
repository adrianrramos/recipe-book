            title: "Chicken Flautas",
            caption: "Some people call them taquitos or tacos dorados, but growing up in South Texas I was raised calling them flautas. They are a very popular item on many restaurants in South Texas, and you can even find flautas in the freezer section of the grocery store. But why buy them frozen when homemade tastes so much better?",

            ingredients: "2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs, 1/2 medium yellow onion, 1 medium tomato sliced, 2 cloves garlic, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon ground cumin",
            steps: "Place everything in a large pot. Place all the shredded chicken ingredients in a large pot. Cover with water. Add enough water to completely cover the chicken by 1 inch. Simmer until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Shred the chicken. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board. Shred with 2 forks and set aside. Make the flautas: Prepare a baking sheet. Heat the oven to 200ºF. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Warm the tortillas. Warm the tortillas on a comal or in the microwave to make pliable. If using the microwave, stack the tortillas on a plate and cover with damp towel. Microwave until pliable, 10 to 15 seconds. Fill the tortillas. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the shredded chicken onto a tortilla. Roll the tortilla up over the filling tightly, then secure with a toothpick so that the filling does not fall out during frying. Place on a plate and repeat with the remaining tortillas. Heat the oil. Add enough oil to a Dutch oven so that it comes up about 2 inches. Heat over medium-high heat until 375ºF. Fry the flautas. Using tongs and working in batches of 4, carefully slide the flautas into the oil and fry until golden-brown and crispy, flipping halfway through, 2 to 4 minutes total. Drain the flautas. Transfer the flautas to the baking sheet and place in the oven until all the flautas have been fried. Serve. Serve warm with shredded lettuce, crema, and avocado slices.",
